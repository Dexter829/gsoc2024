Google Summer of Code 2022 ideas - Neutralinojs

## Make Neutralinojs compatible with older Windows versions

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/486

Neutralinojs is tested on Windows 10 and 11, but it is not well-tested 
with previous Windows versions. The goal of this idea is to update Neutralinojs framework
source, build scripts, and DevOps workflow to officially support older Windows versions.

Areas: Windows API, DevOps, and Configuration
