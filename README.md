## Make Neutralinojs compatible with older Windows versions

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/486

Neutralinojs is tested on Windows 10 and 11, but it is not well-tested 
with previous Windows versions. The goal of this idea is to update Neutralinojs framework
source, build scripts, and DevOps workflow to officially support older Windows versions.

Areas: Windows API, DevOps, and Configuration

## Support Unicode characters in Neutralinojs Windows version

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/466

Neutralinojs Windows version doesn't render Unicode characters correctly.
The goal of this task is to use Windows Unicode APIs and fully support Unicode in the Neutralinojs Windows version.

Areas: Windows API, Refactoring, and Text Encoding
